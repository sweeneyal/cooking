Prep Time: 5 min
Cook Time: 25 min

-   8 boneless, skinless chicken thighs (2 lbs)
-   2 tsp salt, divided
-   1 (24 oz) Jar of marinara sauce
-   4 cups chicken stock or broth
-   1 cup stone ground polenta or yellow cornmeal

Steps (makes 6 servings)
1.  Sprinkle the chicken thighs with 1 teaspoon salt and add them along with the tomato sauce to your pressure cooker, giving it a quick stir to combine.
2.  Cover with the lid. Turn to manual (pressure cook) mode. Cook on high (full pressure) for 5 mins.
3.  Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. Then do a quick release for any remaining pressure.
4.  While the chicken is cooking bring the chicken stock to a boil in a medium sized pot. Whisk in polenta and cook, while stirring, until polenta has absorbed all the liquid, about 12-14 minutes. Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remove from heat. Cover with a lid until ready to serve.
5.  Use two forks to shred the thighs in the tomato sauce. Serve over polenta and enjoy!

*Note: If polenta thickens too much while cooling, return to heat and add in water, Â½ cup at a time. Stir until desired consistency returns.

**Note: This chicken is equally delicious over a bowl of pasta.
