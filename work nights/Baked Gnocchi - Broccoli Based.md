-   1 lb gnocchi
-   3 cups broccoli, florets roughly chopped
-   1 cup stock (vegetable or chicken)

-   2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
-   1 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)

Steps (makes 6 servings)
1. Preheat oven to 400° F.
2. Bring a large pot of salted ** water to a rapid boil. Add broccoli and cook for 2 minutes, add the gnocchi and quickly blanch for 1 minute longer. Drain water and set aside.
3. In a large oven proof skillet, bring the broth to a simmer. Add cream cheese, stirring until it’s mostly combined. Add one cup of the mozzarella cheese and stir until melted.
4. Stir in the broccoli and uncooked gnocchi. Top with mozzarella and bake on the center rack for 15 minutes, or until the top is bubbly. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve immediately. 

*To salt the water we recommend 1 tablespoon to 10 cups of water ratio.
