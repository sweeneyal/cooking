Stir Fry
-   2 tbsp olive oil or vegetable oil
-   1 lb ground beef 90/10
-   1 bell pepper, thinly sliced

-   6 garlic cloves, minced
-   1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves, divided

Steps (makes 4 servings)
1.  In a small bowl combine chili paste, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar and lime juice until incorporated, set aside.
2.  Heat oil in a large skillet set over medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon and stirring often, about 6 minutes.
3.  Add the bell pepper, onion and garlic to the beef and cook until vegetables start to soften, about 5 minutes.
4.  Pour the sauce mixture along with the fresh basil (reserving a fresh few leaves for the top) and continue cooking until basil starts to wilt.
