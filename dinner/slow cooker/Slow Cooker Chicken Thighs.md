- Nonstick cooking spray
- 6 to 8 ounces of boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs per person
- 1/3 cup of honey
- 1/3 cup of ketchup
- 1/3 cup of low-sodium soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1/2 teaspoon of minced ginger
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds
- Chopped scallions
- Cooked white rice

Steps:
1. Coat the insert of a 4.5 quart slow cooker with cooking spray
2. Insert chicken thighs
3. Whisk together honey, ketchup, soy sauce, oregano, pepper flakes, garlic and ginger and pour over the chicken.
4. Cover and cook on low until chicken is cooked, 5-6 hours.
5. Turn off heat, uncover and let rest for 10 minutes before serving.

Thickening the sauce:
1. Remove chicken and set aside, covered to keep warm.
2. Turn slow cooker to high.
3. Stir cornstarch and 2 tablespoons cold water together until it resembles heavy cream.
4. Pour the mixture into the sauce, cover and cook until the sauce is thick and bubbling, roughly 30 minutes. Note: the mixture must come to a boil to activate the starch and thicken the sauce.
5. Return chicken back to sauce and heat the chicken through, about 5 minutes.
