### Attempts
- 2023/10/08 - Brenna and I made this, it had too little liquid in it after adding a bell pepper and the pasta, we added the remaining amount in the chicken broth as well as a bit more whipping cream, and had to reseason to taste. **We forgot the cheese, but it was still good without the cheese. It turned out soupy initially, but the pasta soaked up the sauce at the end, so it was fine without it.** Recommend getting bread for it.
