- Half-Pack Bacon
- Andouille Sausage
- Medium Yellow Onion
- Red Bell Pepper
- Sun Dried Tomatoes
- Tablespoon or so of Garlic
- Cajun Seasoning
- Various Seasonings
- Half-Box Penne
- 1 Cup Heavy Whipping Cream
- 2 Cup Low Sodium Chicken Stock
- 1-3 oz Fresh grated parmesan

Recipe
1. Fry the bacon over medium to medium low heat, and remove when done.
2. Remove some oil (but not all!) since the andouille will also produce oil. Fry the andouille until nice and browned.
3. Dice yellow onion and red bell pepper and add to the pot.
4. Saute for some time, until onion and bell pepper soften, then add garlic and cajun seasoning.
5. Add the sun dried tomatoes.
6. Saute for a bit longer, then add penne, whipping cream, chicken stock, and stir.
7. Cover for 12 minutes over medium low heat until pasta is cooked, stirring occasionally.
8. Add bacon back to pot with fresh grated parmesan, and stir.
9. Add seasonings until you're happy with it, then cut heat.
