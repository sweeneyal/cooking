Attempts:
- 2023/01/02 - using vegetable bouillon, seeing if that works. Could not find tomato bouillon.
- 2023/01/03 - vegetable bouillon removes the acid that the tomato provides. Subbed in tomato paste in addition to the vegetable bouillon. Recommend flouring beef and/or marinating it in red wine, garlic, salt and lemon juice beforehand.
